## Why “Transport Services” Everywhere?

To maintain **clarity** and **consistency**, we use the name **Transport Services** (or “transport_service_app”) throughout:
- **README** (this file)
- **Commit messages**
- **Project files and directories**

Using the same naming in documentation and commit messages ensures:

1. **Clear Identity**: Everyone immediately knows which project the README and commit refer to.
2. **Project Purpose**: The name reminds contributors and users what the project does (i.e., it’s a transport-related service).
3. **Readable Commit History**: Commit messages like “Update README for Transport Services” make it obvious what changed and *why*.
4. **Professional Consistency**: Consistent naming helps avoid confusion, making the project easier to work with for you and any future collaborators.

This approach is a best practice for keeping your project well-documented and easy to understand.
